@Peter there seems to be an issue with verifying a tx with multiple spend inputs - as far as I can tell, it has something to do with the accumulator, and lines 205 - 219 in `zerocoin.cpp`: `passVerify` is failing. Do you have an idea of what the issue might be? What I'm thinking is each spend in the tx is using the same accumulator, and the code cannot handle this scenario, as it reads the accumulator from the latest block..
